# trading agent

## Overview
This project implements an AI oriented trading system. It collects historical market data, processes it (handles missing values and replaces outliers with rolling medians), calculates technical indicators, generates trading signals, and manages a portfolio with trade execution. An optional interactive dashboard displays performance metrics.

## Acknowledgements
This project was jointly developed by Yueying (Celeste) Huang and Lechen (Stella) Gong.

## File Structure
- **main.py**  
  The entry point. It sets up the trading system, defines the date range and ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ, IWM), runs the backtest, and launches the dashboard.

- **datacollect.py**  
  Contains `DataCollectionAgent`, which is responsible for gathering historical market data for specified tickers using yfinance. In addition, it retrieves additional financial data such as financial ratios, the risk-free rate, and a list of available ETFs. Logs are output to the output/trading_system.log file.

- **analysis.py**  
  Contains `AnalysisAgent` for calculating technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR) and generating trading signals.

- **strategy.py**  
  Contains `StrategyAgent` which applies strategy rules (e.g., minimum holding period, maximum trades per week) to generate and execute trade decisions. Logs output similarly.

- **portfolio.py**  
  Contains `PortfolioManagerAgent` that manages the portfolio, calculates position sizes, executes trades, and computes performance metrics like total return, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown.

- **tradesystem.py**  
  Contains `TradingSystem` to orchestrate the data collection, analysis, strategy, and portfolio management modules, as well as report generation and dashboard creation.

- **report_generate.py**  
  Contains `ReportAgent` which is responsible for generating summary reports and visualizations. This module generates a concise summary report using OpenAIâ€™s LLM, and compiles a final DOCX report embedding all the generated plots and summary text. All reports and plots are stored in the 'output' folder.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance, dash, plotly).

2. **Running the Backtest:**
   Execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py
